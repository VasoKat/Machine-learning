# Machine-learning
Machine learning techniques with application to
computer vision problem solving: Download MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset and
illustration of examples, Handwritten digit recognition with Sklearn, Confusion matrix, k-Nearest Neighbors, PCA/k-NN. 
Deep Learning: Neural Network training with PyTorch, Visualizing Weights of Single Layer Perceptron, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP),Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). It was used python, numpy and Jupyter notebook.
